## Case Study Questions and Answers

### Q1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?
```SQL
SELECT
  sales.customer_id,
  SUM(menu.price) AS total_sales
FROM dannys_diner.sales
INNER JOIN dannys_diner.menu
USING(product_id)
GROUP BY
  sales.customer_id
ORDER BY
  total_sales DESC;
  ```



### Q2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?
```SQL
SELECT
  customer_id,
  -- are we missing anything?
  COUNT(DISTINCT(order_date))
FROM dannys_diner.sales
GROUP BY customer_id;
```
>`DISTINCT` was used to ensure date is counted only once if a customer decides to visit the restaurant more than once on that date.


### Q3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?



### Q4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?



### Q5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?



### Q6. Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?



### Q7. Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?



### Q8. What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?



### Q9. If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?



### Q10. In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?



### Q11. Recreate the following table output using the available data:



### Q12. Danny also requires further information about the ranking of customer products, but he purposely does not need the ranking for non-member purchases so he expects null ranking values for the records when customers are not yet part of the loyalty program.
